# tensorflow_object_detection_easy_setup

Based on official Tensorflow installation tutorial and @nicknochnack youtube tutorial I'm creating tool that will hopefully help you with setting up basic environment to start your object detection project. 
It creates every necessary directory, creates virtual environment, clones required github repositories, installs object_detection_api and pretrained models.
